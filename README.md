Objective: Compare two sequences using local and global alignment methods. 
Task: 1. Choose a nucleotide or protein sequence from GenBank. 
2. Perform BLASTN (for nucleotides) or BLASTP (for proteins) against the NCBI database. 
3. Interpret the alignment score, E-value, and percent identity. 
4. Compare results with Needleman-Wunsch (global) and Smith-Waterman (local) algorithms
(using EMBOSS or a Python script- OPTIONAL). 
5. Discuss the significance of high vs. low E-values. 
Expected Output: BLAST report, comparison table of local vs. global alignment.
