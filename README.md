## Sequence Alignment of Insulin Genes
Associated with: PG Diploma in Bioinformatics
Description:
Aligned human and owl monkey insulin protein sequences using BLASTP (NCBI). Interpreted alignment score, percent identity, and E-value. Compared results with global (Needleman-Wunsch) and local (Smith-Waterman) alignments using EMBOSS.

## Dot Matrix Analysis using YASS
Associated with: PG Diploma in Bioinformatics
Description:
Performed dot matrix comparison of human and owl monkey insulin sequences using the YASS tool. Interpreted similarity based on visual dot plot alignment. Compared visual results with BLASTP output to understand conserved regions.
